Write a C++ function that will search a 5 x 5 2D array of integers. Name this function Search_Even. The 5 x 5
array will be passed as an argument to that function. The function will return a vector that contains every
location of where all of the even numbers are located.
If the array contains no even numbers, the vector will only contain the value -1.
Write a complete C++ program that will demonstrate this function working. Output to the console screen a
message indicating that the array contained no even numbers if this is the case. Alternatively, output to the
console screen the locations of each even number (one x and one y coordinate per line).
Making an algorithm before attempting to code this program will be helpful to you.
Example 1:
Array Contents->
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5
The contents of the vector will be-> 0,1,0,3,1,1,1,3,2,1,2,3,3,1,3,3,4,1,4,3
